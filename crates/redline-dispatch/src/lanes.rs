//! How many independent queue lanes to submit PM4 work on.
//!
//! This is a distinct axis from [`crate::partition`], which carves *compute
//! units* for green contexts. Lanes are *queues*: separate hardware submission
//! paths that let independent work progress concurrently.
//!
//! # Why this needs a policy at all
//!
//! The useful lane count is device-specific, is not derivable from any published
//! device property, and overshooting it is catastrophic rather than merely
//! suboptimal. Measured on ROCm 10.0 with N=512 no-op dispatches, host latency
//! per dispatch in microseconds:
//!
//! | lanes | gfx1030 | gfx1100 | gfx1151 | gfx1201 |
//! | ----: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |
//! |     1 |  0.2009 |  0.2239 |  0.2379 |  0.1472 |
//! |     2 |  0.1325 |  0.1331 |  0.1482 |  0.0908 |
//! |     4 |  0.0952 |  0.1005 |  0.0786 |  0.1212 |
//! |     5 |  0.1537 |  0.1568 |  0.1024 |       — |
//! |     8 |       — |       — |       — | 11.7072 |
//!
//! gfx1201 at 8 lanes is 129x worse than the same part at its own 2-lane
//! optimum. That is why [`LaneWidth::Measured`] falls back to
//! [`CONSERVATIVE_LANES`] for devices it does not recognize instead of guessing
//! high: the downside of undershooting is a fraction of the available speedup,
//! and the downside of overshooting is two orders of magnitude.
//!
//! All four parts advertise 128 maximum queues, so the advertised maximum says
//! nothing about the useful width and is deliberately not consulted here.
//!
//! # What these numbers do and do not cover
//!
//! The table is submission cost for empty kernels: it measures the dispatch
//! path, not occupancy. A device's best lane count for real kernels that
//! contend for CUs, cache or memory bandwidth may differ, and nothing here
//! claims otherwise. Callers with a real workload should measure it and pass
//! [`LaneWidth::Explicit`].
//!
//! # Runtime probing
//!
//! The table covers only the parts that were in the lab when it was built. For
//! any other device [`LaneWidth::Measured`] must honestly fall back to
//! [`CONSERVATIVE_LANES`], but a caller can instead ask the runtime to discover
//! the width via [`LaneWidth::Probe`]. Probing is out-of-band and
//! caller-driven: the caller obtains the candidate list from
//! [`probe_plan`], times each lane count on the actual device, selects the
//! winner with [`best_from_samples`], records it in a [`LaneProfile`], and then
//! consults that profile on subsequent resolves. No file IO, no serde, no
//! global mutable state is involved — the profile is an in-memory value the
//! caller owns and threads through [`resolve_with_profile`].
